# Style Guide

This will only list exceptions / additions to the [Roblox Lua Style Guide](https://roblox.github.io/lua-style-guide/).

## Casing

- All **directly publicly exported functions** should be in PascalCase.
- All private functions should be in camelCase.
- **Do not use an underscore unless it is in a public API- in which case, ensure it is gone from the exported type.**
